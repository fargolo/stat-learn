## Abstract
*Abstract*: The zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the  Dirichlet series $\zeta(s)=\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}$, defined for $Re(s) > 1$. Riemann hypothesized that besides the trivial zeros, located at the even negative integers of s$(\zeta(s);s=-2; n=1,2,3,4,...)$, all other zeros would be images of $s$, being $Re(s)=1/2$. Several attempts to prove this have been tried. We hereby present another argument susceptible for examination. The theorem is elaborated based on a physical analogy for the series. We show that each value of $Re(s)$ uniquely determines the second moment of the generating series for $\zeta(s)$. This moment determines rotation angles of an object. We show that $Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$ provides the unique moment to grantee non-trivial zeros.

## Introduction

G. H. Hardy proved that infinitely many nontrivial zeros exist for $Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$. The densisty of zeros on the critical line is at least 41% of all nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$. Numerical calculations have verified the fist $10^13$. In this paper, we provide show that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta have $Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.  

## The fishing rod analogy

Consider the infinite series defined by $\zeta(s)$.  
$$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}, Re(s)>1, Im(s)=0$$
This is the composite size length of infinite line segments, each of them smaller than the previous by $\frac{n^{s}}{(n+1)^{s}}$.  
A physical analogy could be drawn to that of an infinitely sectioned staff. As if we started with $l_{1}=\frac{1}{1^{1}}$ and added progressively smaller pieces $(l_{2}=\frac{1}{1^{s}}+\frac{1}{2^{s}}), (l_{3}=\frac{1}{1^{s}}+\frac{1}{2^{s}}+\frac{1}{3^{s}},l_{4}=...)$ to its end.  

The staff's length (tip) asymptotically approaches $\zeta(s)$  

Considering $Im(s)\neq 0$, one may introduce complex rotations on each of the segments. 

Consider the series $\zeta(s), Re(s)=2, Im(s)=0$.
The corresponding segmented object's length converges to:  
$$\zeta(2)=\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}$$  
$$=\frac{1}{1^{2}}+\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\frac{1}{3^{2}}+...$$
$$\zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}$$  
The identity by Euler which solved the Basel problem.  
We shall now consider our series with imaginary numbers:  
$$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}, Re(s)>1,Im(s)\neq 0$$  

Consider if the imaginary parte of the previous series, $\zeta(2)$, was  $Im(s)=\frac{\pi}{3}i$, then:  
$$\zeta(2 + \frac{pi}{3})=\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2+\frac{\pi}{3}i}}$$
$$=\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}}*\frac{1}{n^{\frac{\pi}{3}i}}$$

By the definition, this is the dot product among vectors with lengths determined by the generating series $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(\frac{\pi}{3}i)$.  

$$\zeta(2 + \frac{\pi}{3}) = \vec{\zeta(2)} \cdot \vec{\zeta(\frac{\pi}{3}i)} = \mid \zeta(2)\mid \mid\zeta(\frac{\pi}{3}i)\mid cos(\theta) $$

The value of $$\zeta(a+bi)$$ converges to the dot product of vectors due to the sum $a+bi$ in the exponent turning the expression into a product of perpendicular vectors:  
$$\zeta(a+bi) = \sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{a+bi}}$$
$$=\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{a}}\frac{1}{n^{bi}}$$
$\vec{\zeta(a)}$, superposing the real axis and magnitude $\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{a}}$, and perpendicular to $\vec{\zeta(bi)}$, superposing the imaginary axis with magnitude $\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{bi}}$.  

Through vector addition, the next segment form and angle $\theta$ with the continuation of the previous one. The fist segment crosses the origin with angle $\theta$ 

$$z = e^{\theta i} \rightarrow = cos(\theta) + sin(\theta)i$$
$z_{s_{n}}=z_{s_{n-1}}+z_{s_{n-2}}+...+z_{s_{1}}$ 


*The fisher rod analogy*: A fish rod has several mathematical similarities with our problem. Consider the idea of an endeless fish rod, whose infinitesimal moving parts eventually become small and thin as a line. Its final size is the number asymptotically approaching by adding smaller pieces according to the series previously presented.

This peculiar fish rod has a spinner. When it is pulled towards the bottom, one may spin it and this will cause the rod to rotate periodically, perpendicular to the real axis.  

Consider the orbit formed by the last point in each segment in a spiral towards the orbit, the attractor. 

The vectorial decomposition of the spiral is $z_{s_{n}}=z_{s_{n-1}}+z_{s_{n-2}}+...+z_{s_{1}}$. 

When $\zeta(s)$ approaches 0, that the vectorial sum approaches the center of the real axis. This is equal to rotate the object enough to cancel its projection on the real axis. 
 
 
The first moment is $M_{1}$. If the $n_{th}$ line segment length is given by $\frac{1}{n^{s}}$, we evaluate the moment around the real axis by the sum the distances $M_{1} = \sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{s}}$.  

Each rod is uniquely determined by its momentums. The second momentum is:
$M_{2} = \sum_{1}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n^{s}})^{2}$. Each $Re(s)$ determines a family of rods. We hereby show that the scenario in which $Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$ is the one containing non-trivial zeta zeros.  

### Non-trivial zeros

Re(s)=1/2 describes orbit in which the critical strip is the envelope.  é o atrator.
